# Sponsors & Backers

DevShop is an GPLv3-licensed open source project. It's an independent project with its ongoing development made possible entirely thanks to the support by these awesome [backers](https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop/blob/1.x/BACKERS.md). If you'd like to join them, please consider:

- [Become a backer or sponsor on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/devshop).
- [Become a backer or sponsor on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/devshop)
- [One-time donation via PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/opendevshop)

What's the difference between Patreon and OpenCollective?
Funds donated via Patreon go directly to support Jon Pugh's full-time work on DevShop. Funds donated via OpenCollective are managed with transparent expenses and will be used for compensating work and expenses for core team members or sponsoring community events. Your name/logo will receive proper recognition and exposure by donating on either platform.
